                     <p>Ferdinand Claiborne Latrobe was born to John H. B. Latrobe, a well-known lawyer from
                        Baltimore and Virginia Charlotte Claiborne on October 14, 1833 in Baltimore, Maryland.
                        He was the grandson of the famous architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe. Ferdinand received
                        his education in public schools in Baltimore and at St. James College, an Episcopal
                        private school founded in 1842, in Washington County, Maryland. At twenty-five, Latrobe,
                        became counsel for the B&amp;O Railroad. Two years later, he was admitted to the Maryland
                        bar and married Louisa Sherlock Swann, the daughter of Thomas Swann and their son,
                        Thomas Swann Latrobe, was born in 1863. Latrobe's first wife died in 1865 and Latrobe
                        married Ellen Primrose in 1880. They had three children: Charlotte Virginia born in
                        1881, Ellen Virginia born in 1883, and Ferdinand Claiborne Latrobe, Jr., born in 1889.
                        Latrobe's first son from his earlier marriage died in 1894. In 1868 Latrobe was elected
                        to the Maryland House of Delegates and was Chairmen of the Ways and Means Committee.
                        He authored the Act of 1868 which reorganized eleven regiments of the Maryland Militia.
                        After serving for several years in the Maryland House, Latrobe was elected Mayor of
                        Baltimore for the first time in 1875. Over the next twenty years, Ferdinand Latrobe
                        served as Mayor of Baltimore seven times. Latrobe served on the board of Maryland
                        State Aid and Board of Charities, the Board of Park Commissioners, and was a member
                        of several arts and music organizations in Baltimore. Latrobe was an avid hunter and
                        spent much of his leisure time at The Crimea, the country estate of Thomas DeKay Winans.
                        Latrobe was also an enthusiastic breeder of Chesapeake Bay Retrievers.

                        legal documents, memorabilia, press clippings, and speeches. There are ten subseries
                        in Series One and approximately 300 pages of documents. Some of the correspondence
                        includes prominent Baltimorean figures. There are letters from Enoch Pratt, Joshua
                        Van Sant, Baltimore mayor from 1871-1875, and Ira Ramsen, President of Johns Hopkins
                        University form 1901-1913. There is a telegram from Vice President of the B &amp; O Railroad,
                        John King, Jr. to Mayor Latrobe in 1877 sent during the Camden Station railroad riot.
                        There are many letters from Baltimore citizens in the subseries "Letters of Congratulations"
                        and "Political" correspondence. Of special interest in Series One are letters from
                        Chun Shen Yin, dating from 1878 to 1879, which Latrobe labeled as from the "Chinese
                        Delegation." It is unclear how Latrobe met the men from the Chinese delegation but
                        it is clear that they kept up a correspondence while the Chinese legation was in America.
                        There are six letters from Chun Shen Yin, one from 1878 and the rest from September
                        and October of 1879. The letters have been transcribed by the processor and are available;
                        some of the words in the letters are illegible and if using the transcription it would
                        be wise to check against the originals. The Baltimore Sun ran an article about the
                        two men from the Chinese legation in September of 1879 which is referenced in one
                        of the letters. An electronic copy of this article is available in the "Cross References"
                        section.
                     </p>
                     <p>In the "Personal Miscellaneous" section is a Civil War document which we know very
                        little about. This document is the only one of its kind within the collection. There
                        are no other papers relating to the Civil War. The document is three pages. The paper
                        is what appears to be albumen paper or a paper photograph. Henry Pollock, the photographer
                        was familiar with both types of photography and practiced them at his studio in Baltimore.
                        The first page is a cover letter. It reads: "This is the replicate paper signed at
                        the Appomattox CH the two others being retained by Lt. Genl. Grant and Genl. Lee.
                        John Gibbon, Maj. Genl. (Vols) Baltimore Md May 10th 1865." At the bottom of the page
                        is signed "Pollock, Photo., Balto." The second and third pages are the actual photo
                        paper/albumen print of the document, the Articles of Agreement relating to the Surrender
                        of the Army of Northern Virginia. The document is in two pages, the first page ending
                        with the third article and the phrase, "allowed to accompany the officers to be…"
                        The third page begins with "turned over at the end of the trip." The document appears
                        to have all of the signatures as on the original. The original document is at the
                        National Archives website: by searching in ARC for the term "Surrender of the Army
                        of Northern Virginia." Subseries Nine is the largest subseries within Series I: Papers
                        and Documents and contains typed, hand-written, and rough draft copies of speeches
                        that Latrobe gave over the course of his career in politics. This subseries is split
                        in two sub-subseries due to the size of the speeches. Speeches written on longer paper
                        are arranged together to better conserve space. As the speeches were not in any particular
                        order when they arrived, they have been arranged according to their size and subject.
                        Subseries Ten contains printed speeches and is arranged chronologically.

                     <p>Series II: Journals and Diaries</p>
                     <p>Series Two is divided into two subseries: 1. Diaries and 2. Account/Memo Books. The
                        diaries and account books of Ferdinand C. Latrobe span decades. Latrobe kept a diary
                        for every year dating from 1888 to 1911 the year of his death. The 1911 diary ends
                        abruptly on January 11, two days before his death. One diary is by an unknown writer
                        and is dated 1922. The diaries reference many important events in Latrobe's life and
                        career. They are not explicit in detail concerning political opinions or events neither
                        are they revealing when it comes to Latrobe's personal life. Latrobe documented the
                        weather daily and each entry begins with a description of the weather for the day.
                        Many entries are concerned with Latrobe's hunting activity and visits. There are two
                        places which Latrobe mentions very often, Crimea and the Island. Crimea was Thomas
                        Dekay Winans country home in West Baltimore in Leakin Park. The Island may refer to
                        the Carroll Island Gun Club, which Latrobe was a member of.
                     </p>
                     <p>The account books date from the mid 1860s and go to 1905. The 1900 Maryland Congressional
                        List book contains printed lists of Maryland Senate and House of Delegates, pasted
                        into the book. Some names are underlined in red ink. This book also contains addresses,
                        notes, and two calling cards: Jacob Knipp and Joseph Pearson Farley, a retired Civil
                        War General. The1893-1894 notebook contains memos, notes to self, accounts, expenses,
                        addresses, and daily appointments. It also contains two sketches/cartoons of men holding
                        whips. The 1889 notebook contains an entry for "Prohibiting all vehicles from standing
                        on Lombard Street, Charles, Hanover, Lexington Market." The notebooks from the 1860s
                        contain a section on Maryland population growth contains figures dating from 18th
                        century and projected into 20th century, including slave and free black population
                        figures.
                     </p>
                     <p>Series III: B&amp;O Railroad Documents</p>
                     <p>Series Three contains documents relating to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company.
                        The first subseries contains one letter from John H.B. Latrobe. It is labeled "Letter
                        of PE Thomas, after the decision in MD Court of Appeals regards the RR Company" and
                        is dated, January 5, 1830. It is not known who labeled the letter. The bulk of this
                        series contains documents pertaining to a dispute between railroad locomotive engineers,
                        Ross Winans and the B&amp;O Railroad, master machinist, Henry Tyson from 1856-1857. This
                        subseries contains pamphlet documents, correspondence, rough drafts, and copies. It
                        is arranged by similar subject, paper, and corresponding numbering on pages when applicable.
                        It is unclear how Latrobe came to have these documents. Latrobe was counsel for the
                        B&amp;O RR, beginning in 1858, and may have inherited the papers with the position or
                        he may have been given the papers by his father who also served as counsel for the
                        B&amp;O RR. The dispute between Ross Winans and Henry Tyson is well-documented in The
                        story of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, 1827-1927, by Edward Hungerford, published
                        in 1928. The majority of the documents may be drafts of statements issued to Latrobe
                        by Ross Winans or to whoever was the legal counsel for the B&amp;O at the time. These
                        documents describe a pamphlet written by Tyson which alleges that the camel back engines
                        caused accidents in which a few men were killed. It seems that the pamphlet alleged
                        that the engines and cars were unsafe and a new design should be implemented. The
                        dispute is generally recognized to have led to Ross Winans giving up his career in
                        railroad locomotive engineering, as he closed his shop shortly afterwards. These documents
                        could be of great interest to historians of the railroad industry.

                     <p>MSS 2004-01; This collection was donated by Mary Jane Arnold, as a gift from her late
                        husband, in the summer and fall of 2004. Eminent Baltimore historian Jospeh Arnold
                        collected many items on Baltimore history. The papers of Ferdinand C. Latrobe were
                        part
                        of a larger collection which included books and other manuscripts.

                     <p>This collection was processed under the supervision of Marcia Peri by Angelica Marini.
                        The processing and organizing of the collection began in January 2007 and was completed
                        in May 2007. When processing began, the only visible organization was that the papers
                        were separate from diaries and journals. The diaries and journals were ordered
                        chronologically. Papers and other documents were arranged by type and then by subject,
                        alphabetical if applicable. Most of the correspondence was labeled personally by
                        Ferdinand Latrobe, with subject headings and the collection retains those labels.
                        Railroad documents that had no specific mention of Ferdinand Latrobe were arranged
                        into
                        a separate series and arranged as well as could be, as most are fragments of papers
                        concerning a dispute in the 1850s. The finding aid was reformatted in 2008. Series

                              			The bulk of this series contains documents pertaining to a dispute between railroad
                              locomotive engineers, Ross Winans and Henry Tyson. This subseries contains pamphlet
                              documents, rough drafts, and copies. It is arranged by similar subject, paper, and
                              corresponding numbering on pages when applicable. This set of documents is not arranged
                              alphabetically by material. The papers of the dispute all seem to be by Ross Winans
                              promoting his side of the argument over the best locomotive engines to build and use
                              by the B &amp; O Railroad.
