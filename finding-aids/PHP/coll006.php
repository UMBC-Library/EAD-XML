                     <p>Mildred Grossman (1916-1988) was a New York City public school teacher, civil rights
                        activist, unionist, and an award-winning photographer. She is well-known for her documentary
                        photography, association with the Photo League, and involvement with many unions and
                        activist organizations. She led 32 other teachers in a civil case against the New
                        York City Public Schools after they were fired for accusations of being Communist
                        sympathizers.

                     <h2>Note</h2>
                     <p>This collection contains the papers, photographs, books, and ephemera of Mildred Grossman
                        Berkowitz. The documents span from her high school years in 1929 until seven years
                        after her death, in 1995. The collection is divided into six series, based both on
                        type of activity and kind of document. As a general rule, documents within series
                        have been arranged in date order. The first series, Union Activism, is based on Mildred's
                        activities with various unions. The bulk of this series is included in the first sub-series,
                        "Teachers' Union," which includes details about Mildred's tireless efforts to reinstate
                        thirty-three teachers that had been expelled from the New York City Public School
                        system in the 1950s due to suspected Communist leanings. The transcript for Diana
                        Wolman's (one of the teachers) HUAC hearing can be found (in html format) at http://www.access.gpo.gov/congress/senate/mccarthy/83869.txt.
                        Because of the focus of the series on a particular activity, it includes various kinds
                        of documents, such as correspondence, case files, clippings, and notes. From the beginning
                        of her work on the case until 1974, when the teachers were finally reinstated, there
                        is evidence of the close friendships that were built between the people working on
                        the case.
                     </p>
                     <p>The second sub-series, "Hotel Union," contains photographs and documents relating
                        to Mildred's work with the Hotel Trade Council for an exhibit called "Portrait of
                        a Union." The papers include the history of the union until the exhibit, as well as
                        goals and challenges that still needed to be met by the hotel workers. The photographs
                        included in this series, which were originally included with the rest of the HTC papers,
                        are of various workers in the hotel industry. More photographs of the workers are
                        included in the photography section, but as these were specifically part of the HTC
                        exhibit, they have been retained in the series. The second series is Notes and Correspondence.
                        Mildred was a copious note taker, and kept a record of every meeting she attended
                        (and as a member of the ASMP, the Teachers' Union, the Workman's Circle, and other
                        numerous groups, there were many meetings that she attended throughout her life).
                        Particularly prevalent in the notes is information regarding an exhibit depicting
                        the history of the Hotel Trade Council called "Portrait of a Union." The actual drafts
                        and photos are in the first series, mentioned above, but all of Mildred's handwritten
                        notes on the subject are included here.
                     </p>
                     <p>This series includes the bulk of Mildred's correspondence aside from that dealing
                        with the Teachers' Union case. It includes professional letters requesting photographs
                        (for exhibits, publications, etc.), commissions for Mildred's photography skills (from
                        the Hotel Trades Council and the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union),
                        various correspondence regarding employment (with Long Island University, Special
                        Services of Queens, and the NY Public Schools), personal correspondence (of particular
                        note is Wendell Phillips Dodge, noted explorer), and medical correspondence pertaining
                        to both Mark and Mildred. A postcard from 1939 indicates Mildred's membership in the
                        American Labor Party.
                     </p>
                     <p>The third series, Financial, includes all of Mildred's documents relating to her finances.
                        As noted above, she was a very careful note-taker, and kept records for just about
                        everything. Included in the series are receipts and bills for various objects or services
                        that Mildred used, such as furniture, photography, and electricity, or that she provided,
                        such as photographs. There are detailed records in Mildred's handwriting of various
                        transactions throughout the years, as well as her notes regarding how much compensation
                        she should receive from the state of New York as compensation for the loss of money
                        while suspended from teaching. Two sub-series are particularly noteworthy. The first,
                        "German Pension Papers," does not deal with Mildred directly, but rather her husband.
                        Because Motel Berkowitz had been in a concentration camp during World War II, he was
                        entitled to reparations from the German government. This series includes some legal
                        papers (in Polish, German, and English), regarding the reparations, as well as documents
                        proving Motel's eligibility for the pension plan, verifying his identity and history.
                     </p>
                     <p>The second sub-series, "Insurance Papers," consists of correspondence between Mildred,
                        her lawyer Benjamin Zelman (who was also the lawyer on the Teachers' Union case),
                        and Mutual of Omaha Insurance Co. Mildred's insurance policy was for teachers only,
                        and so the insurance company tried to verify that Mildred was actually teaching. Mildred,
                        in her inimitable stubborn way, refused to answer the question, resulting in subsequent
                        lawyer intervention and many letters from the insurance company. All of the correspondence
                        in the sub-series is included in duplicate.
                     </p>
                     <p>The fourth series contains both medical and legal documents relating directly to Mildred
                        or her family. Included in this series are numerous passports for Mildred and Motel,
                        as well as Mildred's IDs for the NY Department of Social Services and The Cooper Union.
                        Included with Mark's passports are international certificates of vaccination. In terms
                        of legal documents, the contents are rather eclectic. Mildred's high school career
                        is depicted here, with a diploma, a report card, and various awards she received while
                        in school (from the Little Mothers' League, the Anti-Litter Bureau, the Arista League,
                        Spanish class, the Service League, Honor Roll distinctions, and a scholarship certificate
                        from The City College of New York). Various other legal documents include a certified
                        copy of a birth certificate, various travel documents, immigration documents for Mildred's
                        parents and husband, and a teaching certificate. Also included are a draft and an
                        actual contract for Mildred's work with the Hotel and Club Employees Union Local 6.
                     </p>
                     <p>The medical documents in the collection relate to both Mildred and Motel, including
                        a notification of Mildred's death from the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York.
                        It also includes membership information in The Workman's Circle's insurance plan.
                        Funeral papers seemed appropriate to include with medical papers, and so the series
                        also includes information about the burial and perpetual for by Motel. Included as
                        well is a series of drafts for a eulogy delivered at Mildred's funeral, and an envelope
                        with Mildred's gravesite address that included pictures of his late wife. Series V
                        includes a mix of documents that do not fit into one of the above series. Included
                        is Mildred's yearbook, "The Lexicon," from the School of Business and Civil Administration
                        of the College of the City of New York, a number of address books, various awards
                        and honors received by Mildred Grossman, for photography, alcoholism recovery training,
                        and the Teachers' Union case. (Mildred did receive a certificate from the National
                        Urban League, which was not included in this series, as it was considered an attachment
                        to a letter, and so was included with general correspondence. Also included are clippings
                        and printed materials regarding Mildred's various projects, often including Mildred's
                        photographs, regarding the Hotel Workers Union, The Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers
                        International Union, and the Teachers Union. Published materials that were retained
                        with the collection, such as books regarding legalities of teachers and teaching in
                        New York are included here. Other publications retained in the collection a magazine
                        called "Friday" from January 1941, "There Are Men Inside: A presentation by Oil, Chemical
                        and Atomic Workers International Union," and "Hotel and Club Voice" (November 1963),
                        all of which contain images photographed by Mildred. Other miscellanea are various
                        membership cards and photographic (unmailed) postcards belonging to Mildred Grossman,
                        exhibition catalogs, a press release regarding an exhibit and some of Mildred's applications
                        for various exhibitions. A final sub-series within the Miscellaneous is not at all
                        connected with Mildred or her various projects. This sub-series contains extensive
                        information on the Gizela and Rafael Federmans, Motel's sister and brother-in-law,
                        who came to the United States after World War II. The sub-series contains miscellaneous
                        photographs, various Yiddish publications by Rafael regarding the Jewish Labor Bund,
                        immigration and death certificates, and a will for Rafael Federman, written in Yiddish.
                     </p>
                     <p>The sixth series, Diaries/Daybooks, quite possibly contains the materials for a researcher
                        to see Mildred as she lived her daily life. This includes Mildred's planners, daybooks,
                        and diaries, spanning about forty years of her life. The earliest book included here
                        is a diary from 1950 recording one of her trips abroad with fascinating details of
                        some of the people that she met. Eleven daybooks, from 1959-1969, list Mildred's day-to-day
                        events and appointments. Papers that had been inserted into the daybooks were sometimes
                        kept and sometimes removed to other folders, depending on appropriateness. Some, such
                        as photo lists, miscellaneous notes, Peanuts comic strip clippings (1964, 1966), and
                        a list of birthdays and anniversaries (1966) have been left in the books for context.
                        Correspondence, ID cards, and receipts, however, have been removed to their respective
                        folders. The back of the daybooks include a "cash account" section, which Mildred
                        used to list monthly transactions. The four daily planners (1976-1977, 1979, 1981)
                        include similar information as the daybooks, albeit in less detail.
                     </p>
                     <p>The seventh series contains Mildred Grossman's personal photos, including six photo
                        albums as well as loose photographs. This series also includes photographs taken by
                        photographers other than Mildred (generally personal photos). Her professional photos
                        have been removed to the UMBC photography collection. The eighth series contains items
                        of ephemera: Six stamps belonging to Mildred that were used for labeling her photographs,
                        and her Leica "flash unit" in a box.

                     <p>PHMS 2002-23, 2003-01; This collection was donated by Mark Berkowitz, and arrived
                        in two accessions. The first, consisting of Mildred's photos, included two loose-leaf
                        binders contained 120 photographs, as well as silver prints and negatives. This came
                        from the house of Mark Berkowitz on 12/15/89. The second accession came from Minerva
                        Contreras on 12/17/02, and included the Mildred Grossman Archive, as well as a total
                        of 5810 items in a combination of photographs and negatives.

                     <h2>Processing Note</h2>
                     <p>The collection was processed by Michelle Margolis under the supervision of Marcia
                        Frank Peri and completed in May 2006. The collection arrived in a generally good condition,
                        in regular boxes, for both accessions. The contents were wrapped in brown paper in
                        the first accession.
                     </p>
                     <p>For the sake of preservation, acid-damaged papers were copied onto acid-free paper,
                        and the original papers were retained. There were four folders in the collection that
                        had been labeled by Mildred, but only one ("Press and Pressure") was retained with
                        the original title, as the other folders did not seem to have any unifying factors,
                        nor were the titles appropriate to the contents. Of the remaining folders, "Currin"
                        was renamed "Insurance Papers," and "My Mistakes" and "Book Prints" were included
                        with the Hotel Union Papers. Staples and paper clips were removed from the documents,
                        and envelopes were generally discarded (except in one case, where the decoration,
                        hand-drawn on the actual envelope was quite unique) unless it was needed for identification
                        of a date of correspondence. One envelope, left unopened when the collection was received,
                        has remained unopened. In the case of multiple copies of any documents, only two were
                        retained.
                     </p>
                     <p>A number of books not directly related to Mildred or the collection have been removed
                        from the collection, to be placed in stacks. A list of those books follows the processing
                        notes. Although there is a folder for Awards and Honors, the certificate from the
                        National Urban League has been included in the Correspondence and Notes, as it is
                        actually an enclosure to a letter. The professional photographs and negatives included
                        in the collection have been removed to the UMBC Photography collection, and are unprocessed
                        as of May 23, 2006. Due to the relatively small size of the collection, the correspondence
                        and other dated documents have been arranged in simple date order.
